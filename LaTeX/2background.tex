%You can translate your latex file to rtf with the \texttt{latex2rtf} command in the
%kosh.aalto.fi shell server. Then, the line breaks
%will not be problems for the proofreader of Word.

%Note also that if you have a section or a subsection, you have to have
%at least two of them, or otherwise the section or subsection title is
%unnecessary. Same with the paragraphs: you should not have sections
%with only one paragraph, and single sentence paragraph.
