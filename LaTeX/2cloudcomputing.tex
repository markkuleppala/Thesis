\chapter{Virtualization and Cloud Computing}
\label{chapter:cloudcomputing}

Cloud computing is a vital enabler in the field of Information Technologies. The ubiquitous and connected computing provided allows higher usage of resources and access from anywhere via internet, thus improving performance, reducing costs, and allowing easy access to hosted applications.

Cloud is typically a centralized server, such as, Microsoft Azure or Red Hat OpenShift. These cloud platforms provide users with scalable resources, very high availability and fast connections. Cloud platforms can be public, such as the before-mentioned ones, or a private cloud serving only selected customers. Private clouds are usually deployed on-premises by businesses with requirements for additional control and privacy over the network. \cite{MicrosoftAzure}

Hybrid cloud is a combination of both, made up of on-premises infrastructure, private cloud services, and a public cloud. The hybrid approach brings enterprise with agility to use the best suitable solution for each occasions. \cite{NetApp}


\section{History of cloud computing}

The concept of virtualization technologies dates back to 

\section{Far Edge Cloud}

\section{Virtualization}

Virtualization takes advantage of the cloud computing platform. That is, software can be installed allowing multiple instances of virtual servers to be used \cite{Velte2009}.

Run different guest OS in different host OS

With the help of virtualization a single physical server can run a dozen of separate virtual servers.
