% 1) ignore the LaTeX warnings 
% 2) use the textpos-package to manually position the table (read the package

% because LaTeX tries to justify the text in the cells) you can manually set
% the text to unjustified by using the \raggedright command for each cell 
% that you do not want to be justified (see the example below). \raggedleft
